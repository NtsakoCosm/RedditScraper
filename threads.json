What are the odds someone who wasn't supposed to live past their 20s would live to be 76, and not only blow most people away with his intelligence but pretty much reinvent how we saw the trait and who can have it? If he was born before recorded history the sensible thing to do would be to disregard him as a folktale because obviously someone just made him up.",

His view was that Hawking was a genius but a difficult person, and a fair few people avoided him.\n\nI've heard similar things about a good many other high profile academics (as well as businesspeople). That takes nothing away from their achievements, but I think it's also important to remember that not everyone that is good in one domain is an all around good person.",

His motor skills got a bit better after that. But he was still having problems. They went to a doctor to figure out what was going on. They found out about it sometime in September I think it was. It was so sad to see such a strong willed man just deteriorate like that over the course of a few months. We knew he didn't have long and his daughter was getting married in the spring but we had a ceremony at his home before he passed. He didn't last much longer after that. I took a video of the ceremony and at one point he looks back at me in the video and I can see how far gone he is when you look into his eyes it still haunts me a bit and I'll probably never show that video to anyone just because of how empty he looked at that point.",

She went from walking with a cane to a wheelchair rather quickly I think. The last year she had troubles talking, well she just talked slowly. I do remember near the end it sounded like she was talking better.\n\nI can tell you it sucks. You know it does. The pain doesn't go away, but it will fade but can come back sometimes.

It sucks to see someome who you percieve as \"having it made\" needing to face death in the span of a few months.\n\nHe was having trouble with his knee, so he saw a doctor after a few weeks. At the time of his diagnosis, they gave him about 2-5 years.\n\nHe died less than a year after that. The deterioration was terrible and rapid. It killed me to see him -he was so heavily medicated on tramadol and klonapin early on that he could barely communicate. He expressed distress and confusion about the drugs (which is frustrating because theyre supposed to be comfort meds -do we really have nothing better to give our terminally ill?).\n\nIf i am ever a vegetable, dont feed me benzos. The drugs were overkill in his case, and as a result my uncle spent a lot of his last months in a very confused, frustrated, and amnesic state.\n\nGo hug someone you love.",

I used to be an avid Runner and cyclists, but now require help to even dress myself or make it to my scooter. Next week I get measured up for a wheelchair. ALS is more of a grouping of conditions by a set of symptoms. It seems to be different for everyone on how fast it progresses. I was diagnosed after having symptoms for two years and given about one year to live. I'm still here and, sadly, Stephen is not. May he rest in peace.",

When I first got out of the hospital, I had a lot of time on my hands, mostly spent romping around in my own mind trying to make sense of everything that'd happened along with how I sincerely felt about nearly dying. Like many, I turned to what I knew how to do best, in order to facilitate my coming to terms with, or have what I like to call my \"Lt. Dan vs. The Hurricane moment\"... I researched and wrote. On one of my many treks through the internet, using Google as my sherpa, I found a Stephen Hawking quote that felt very aprop\u00f3s for summing up the whole situation. The last 2 sentences especially. I ended up reading a lot on Hawking and slowly have been working my way through his writings. I've wanted it tattooed on me, I've wanted a second tattoo, seems perfect to shoot for. My best friend, Jeremy, even offered to scrall it on me (maybe his handwriting for the stencil for the pro to put it on. \u201cI have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I\u2019m not afraid of death, but I\u2019m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.\u201d RIP",

He didn't feel superior, but rather had a lot of love for other human beings.\n\nHis character was even more inspiring than his work. Truly a great man and rolemodel. RIP.",

In an odd way, the universe is giving an homage to the man who probably understood it most, by allowing him to exist, then cease to exist. He wasn't, then he was, now he isn't.\n\nI first read A Brief History of Time in the 7th or 8th grade, and understood about half of it (the easy half). Read it again as a senior in high school and understood about 75% of it. I'm now 31, and read it again earlier this year, and now realize that I never even understood 10% of it. If I'm being honest, I'm just now beginning to hear even the lightest of whispers of what he tried to teach to us, what he understood.\n\nI'm just happy that we were privileged to live during a time where we learned and grew our understanding of the world alongside Dr. Hawking. He wasn't some figure from a history book, he was a fellow living, breathing human being.\n\nThank you and godspeed, Dr. Hawking.",

I struggle a lot with the small things in life, and for me this is one of those lines that gives the context of how small and insignificant those things really are.

For someone to die who had lived such a fulfilling life, had contributed so much to humanity's understanding, had accomplished more than is expected of any human despite being afflicted by disease, you just can't help but to not feel bad. Instead it makes you reflect on the beauty of how he lived, how we should all aspire to live courageously in pursuit of our dreams during this short pit-stop of life that we've been gifted.",

One, you begin to realize more and more how much knowledge there really is out in the world. Two, we tend to get more humble as we mature. To the point where I don't have to define myself by what I know and what I can/will do, but actually define myself by what I've actually done and the things that are important to me like my wife, friends, faith, hobbies, etc.",

His love of the universe, passion for the greater understanding of how it all works and drive despite his health issues were and are incredibly inspirational. I will miss you, Dr. Hawking. May you rest easy.\n\nFor those who want more info:\n\nDr. Hawking is well known both in the scientific community and the general public. As a fairly controversial figure he has been a positive voice in favor of manned space travel, a staunch atheist, a concerned voice about future AI, and a shining light on astrophysics in general. He will be greatly missed within the scientific community.\n\nDr. Hawking was a prolific author of books for the layman, if you are interested he wrote the following:\n\nA Brief History of Time\n\nBlack Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays\n\nThe Universe in a Nutshell\n\nOn The Shoulders of Giants\n\nGod Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History\n\nThe Dreams That Stuff Is Made of: The Most Astounding Papers of Quantum Physics and How They Shook the Scientific World\n\nMy Brief History\n\nThe Grand Design\n\nHe and his daughter have also written several children's books. For a complete list please see their website.\n\nA movie version of his life was also released in 2014 titled The Theory of Everything.\n\nALS or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also known in the U.S. as Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes:\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a group of rare neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, walking,\u00a0and talking. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease.\n\nDr. Hawking was diagnosed at 21 and not expected to live passed the age of 25. Only roughly 10 percent of ALS patients live more than 10 years.",

Reeve's choices led to him being largely paralyzed, whereas Hawking had no choice in the matter.\n\nSource: Former equestrian show circuit rider and competitor. One of my 13-year-old friends died in a similar accident to Reeve's when I was 15. Injuries like Reeve's are much more common among higher or more advanced levels, and are part of the inherent risk of competing in the sports of horseback riding. Broken necks, instances of paralysis, serious injuries, comas, and even death aren't uncommon to hear about in the show circuits.",

(Nothing wrong with that, I'm glad they do it. But it does get a little frustrating to hear about \"the wonders of the universe\" for the umpteenth time on every science show.)\n\nHawking was quotable and could give a good, layman-level, simplified summary, but mostly the stuff he was working on was really, really hard! You can only simplify the implications of black-hole radiation so much.\n\nWatching a pop-science lecture is educational and fun because they work to make it easy to understand.\n\nWatching or reading a Hawking lecture is like trying to hit major-league pitching. Even if they go easy on you, it's just never going to be easy. You have to work as hard as you can to even get a piece of it, and Hawking (like Feynman) made you want to. To get just a little taste of what it's like to play in the big leagues.",

He took fifty-five.\n\nProfessor Hawking did so much to advance science, both at the frontiers of physics and in its popularity among common folk. Some of his achievements may never be equaled, and his name will go down in history alongside those of Newton and Einstein. But I think Professor Hawking would agree with me in hoping that this is one accomplishment which is surpassed very soon.",

Alas it was too many years ago and I don't remember the details, but part of it had to do with the fact that we know that there are multiple genetic markers that correspond with an increased likelihood of a person developing ALS.\n\nWith ALS typically a person progresses to the point where they cannot eat or breathe. It isn't really that a person loses the strength to fight it (most people are diagnosed in middle age, often otherwise healthy and fit, and most die within 5 years) but that eventually their neurones waste to the point where they can't breathe or eat anymore.",

One year after diagnosis, he needs a walker to get around. He can barely talk. He\u2019s just frail as all get out. His diagnosis was reasonably late, as he had early signs for about a year before he saw someone and got diagnosed. Given his decline, I doubt he has another 6 months or so, at least, until he\u2019s completely paralyzed and requires feeding tubes and the like.\n\nShit\u2019s not fair.

These genes can be hereditary (something like 10% of cases), or mutations, but either way they cause abnormal proteins to be expressed which accumulate in the brain. Specifically, in those diagnosed with ALS, these proteins accumulate near the upper and/or lower motor neurons. Depending on how much of these proteins accumulate, what proteins they are, and where they accumulate, it affects the body differently. The cause of death is usually respiratory failure, when the motor neurons controlling the lungs are affected, or dehydration/malnutrition when the muscles that allow you to swallow are affected. By putting the person on a ventilator, or using a feed tube, respectively, many of those with ALS can be kept alive virtually indefinitely.\n\nEdit: Not a doctor, someone correct me if my understanding is incorrect.",

The mantra of every college graduate who feels their opinion in anything outside of the basic academic understanding of their specific field is somehow weighted in relevancy.\n\nIt's the fault of current education system. College graduate is educated but not educated enough to understand how little they know. This applies to their specific field too.",

USAF for twelve years then my bachelor's and finished my post-grad out of UoI-Urbana in Phase/EE.\n\nI just relegated it to youth and inexperience. I've been assessing applicants for the last three weeks for a dozen positions and it feels like there's been a very real degeneration in the institution when on a comparitive basis from 2002, 2008 and 2012. They seem to be running the other direction of 'stick to the basics'.\n\nEducation is now a business model with a heavy dose of indoctrination. Crossing my fingers that this trendline doesn't continue.",

We have the potential to have an entire generation of young scientists just on what we have available in youtube alone. And how prevalent the information we have is? Come on! Imagine what information Einstein or Hawking or any other great mind had growing up, and what our children have as a base-line!\n\nWe've lost a great mind, but these comments make it seem like we will never see his ilk again simply because there are few inspirations. I say, we have even more inspirations!\n\nWho cares if the personalities we have inspiring our young minds are \"only personalities\"? They're still inspiring them to be interested in maths and sciences, to wonder and worry about the stars and mysteries of our world.\n\nIt's sad that we've lost a fantastic mind, and a pioneer in the world of science, but it saddens me even more to think that people think we will decline because of this. If anything this should inspire young minds more, to pick up where Stephen Hawking left off.\n\nThere's nothing ahead of us but the future.\n\nEdit: After a brief walk of my dog: To think! As children we (myself and those older than me) only had the library, Carl Sagan, and maybe the Discovery Channel (before it turned into what it is now) as inspiration and guidance into the sciences. Today people have the entire breadth of human knowledge at their fingertips in their pockets! Mere seconds away! What wonders we might achieve!",

Ask someone of my parents generation and they'll never have heard of him, even most people the same age as me (40s) wouldn't recognise his name unless they were very interested in science or used Reddit\n\nThat's not to say he's not a good scientist, he just hasn't had lots of extremely popular TV series.\n\nBrian Cox is one of the most famous people on British television, his series pull in millions and packs out live appearances.

In a way, physics is as much an art as it is a science.\n\nTldr don't downplay your own ability to understand it! Anyone is capable, and noisy understand more than they think they do (unless they think they understand 'it all')",

Einstein's discoveries changed everything. They were revolutionary comparable to a once every 300-400 year advancement.\n\nRight now, most theoretical physicists believe that Ed Witten is Einstein's successor. He's the powerhouse behind String Theory. He didn't invent it, but he revolutionized it. It had been dead for a few decades until he came along with some massive breakthroughs. If string theory ends up being correct, then Ed Witten's contributions and advancements would be equivalent to Einstein's theory of Relativity. No, actually it would be more because Witten would have done what Einstein couldn't do (but was trying) before he died; reconcile Quantum Mechanics with Relativity.",

I am by no means saying Hawking did anything as revolutionary as relativity, wave-particle duality, photoelectric effect, or whatever other foundation of Einstein's we are currently standing on (though that is all subjective). Yes, if Ed Witten is correct and unifies quantum with macro due to string theory, that would blow away anything done since Einstein. My only meaning was that, ignoring actual impacts in physics, Hawking has left a profound legacy on the current scientific community on par with Einstein. You could have probably asked any random person who the smartest person on the planet was and 8/10 he'd be your answer because he was the face of physics. Whether or not he deserved that spot is definitely debatable but the fact is, he had it. I just can't think of many who had a similar spot in the public eye since Einstein which is why I made my comment.",

All my life, though, I've been coming back to Physics and Math, doing some sporadic reading, wishing I could pursue either field seriously, because it always felt like they were fundamental to everything we see around us, and the universe in general. I never got around to doing anything about it, but this man is one of the big reasons I kept coming back. Just last night, some kind of spark was reignited for some reason, and I went back to a lot of old theory - rifling through my school textbooks, just enjoying the feeling of learning. I stayed up all night going from one resource to another, and the rabbit hole took me to Sabrina Pasterski and then this paper. I can't believe that just a few hours after that, the man who wrote it is gone.\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm rambling on. I'm in shock, and I guess I'm trying to say that I promise to never ignore my longing to learn science again. I will pursue it, if nothing else, to honor this great man. He gave his life to it, and gave us so much. With both my spirit and flesh willing, it's a crime to not commit. If you've actually read this far, I apologize for going on and on, but I promise you, whoever you are, that I'm going to try. And I will keep coming back to this post, this thread, and this great, great man's life whenever I wander away from this promise. I hope that one day, I can say with pride that Stephen Hawking inspired my scientific journey.\n\nRest in peace, sir. We will never let your name or your unmeasurable work and impact be forgotten.",

I am weirdly surprised I feel this way. I guess I had more faith in someone like him than I thought. I guess it was important to me that we had a household name super-genius in the public awareness.

Far off, there was a whirring noise that steadily grew louder and everyone stopped when we saw that it was Professor Hawking hurtling down the path in his chair. About 20 feet behind him was his nurse struggling to keep up.\n\nSilence. We all just stood there in complete shock, surprise and excitement. It was akin to seeing Einstein at a bus stop, or Newton at the supermarket. It turned out that he was there to give a lecture to the university's Mathematical Society.\n\nWithin seconds he had gone and everyone simply started at each other. We had all shared a totally wonderful, totally surreal moment.\n\nGoodnight Professor Hawking. Sleep well.",

People in this thread are taking about other celebrity scientists like Greene, Tyson, Kaku but I feel the need to point out that those guys while smart, are not even close to being on the same level. Hawking's contributions to science are up there with Feynman and Dirac. I'd even put them near Einstein.\n\nHe discovered and explained a phenomenon that gives us deep insight into the connection between quantum mechanics and general relativity. His work is revolutionary and he developed it around the same time when quantum gravity started to be a serious problem in physics. The only reason he didn't win the Nobel was that Hawking radiation is too weak to detect and therefore unmeasurable. Every theorest though agrees that he is correct and use his ideas without a second thought. He'll go down in history as one of the pioneers of quantum gravity and one of the 'giants' that future scientists will stand on the shoulders of.",

This is extremely symbolic to me. He will go down as a modern-day genius and will be talked about for 100's of years to come. The day he died will only add to his mysticism. RIP Mr. Hawking.",

After reading A Brief History of Time as an impressionable 14 year old I dreamt of following in your treadmarks. Now, 7 years later I am a Materials Science student at Cambridge although it isn't cosmology I still feel I owe a great deal to you and your books for inspiring me to get into science and without those I may not be where I am today. Every scientific communicator and the majority of scientists around today owe you a great deal for inspiring us and future generations and getting the public into science. If I can inspire one person to go into science in my future career I'll be proud but you inspired the entire globe. And then you taught me that our heroes are human and real when I saw you, not 10 meters away, in a department store and later at a dinner I was attending.\n\nThere's going to be a weird air in Cambridge today; one of somberness and sadness but mostly one of celebration for the work you did and for the inspiration you planted in every scientist here.",

Hawking inspired me to always look at the grand picture and to keep asking questions.\n\nDespite the sad news we bare today, let us remember the man for his accomplishments. Let us not forget the battle he faced for 55 years every single day. Let us be inspired by his work and his legacy.\n\nHis body may now be gone, but his mind, is finally free.

What he did was he threw a party and invited the whole entire world to come at a specific time and date, however he did not send out the invitations until after the party l, asking for time travelers. As we expected no one showed up (poor Stephen) however this method blew my mind as a child and taught me that there is an infinite amount of ways to gather knowledge and you don't need to know everything to know something.\n\nA man who was constrained to a chair for a majority of his life was able to travel outside the box most of us can never escape. Although Stephen Hawking is no longer with us he will forever be an inspiration to science just as Einstein and many others",

I study a completely different field of science, but Stephen Hawking will forever be an inspiration for me while pursuing scientific knowledge or just life in general.

I remember thinking his voice was cool and my dad explaining to me why he spoke through a computer program. It was so impressive to 8 or 9 year old me that he was so smart even though he really had no control over his body. That book on tape really catapulted my interest in the universe, which shaped my entire worldview in a lot of ways. So I owe him so much for that.",

The consideration that you will be forever limited in everything that you will ever do. Watching those who surround you, desperately trying to help you, falling into desperation.\n\nBut even then, we both faced the adversity with a positive reaction and we both went on with our lives.\n\nI can't even imagine the amount of people who right now might be in the same situation, those who suffered from the same or similar diseases who also took this wonderful man as a source of inspiration and maybe those who will be right now suffering from a hopeless future, getting to know that there was this one man, who even with such a mortal and debilitating disease, was able to pass on to history as one of humanity's greatest minds.\n\nNot only will i deeply miss you Professor, so will the rest of the world and the future generations of this race.",

He discovered radiance in all-consuming darkness and in his relentless pursuit of the mysteries in that darkness he enlightened us to the nature of that locomotion. I would ask he be left to rest in peace but what peace can a soul of such relentless determination to solve life's mysteries find? His spirit and passion shall instead live on to inspire and cultivate a generation of scientists and knowledge seekers. His memory shall continue to unearth the mysteries of the universe long after he himself has confined himself to antiquity. His was the temperament of a scientist. He lived as one and he died as one. Now that his reservoir of courage has faded we must continue that scientific tradition of experimentation, contemplation, and revelation in his memory and name. It was his passion to pursue knowledge. Let us carry on that passion. Let us carry on the name Stephen Hawking with the same nurture of knowledge he championed, long after he has been silenced by the Earth.",

As someone who struggles to understand a lot of principles in science, and who deeply worries about the future of humanity.. I've always just felt calmed by the fact that there was someone out there who had a truly brilliant mind, who could make some sense of all of those scary science-y theories, and whose entire life was dedicated to understanding what I cannot.\n\nIt sounds dumb, but knowing that Stephen Hawking was studying all that shit and working hard to learn more about the universe just kinda made me feel like everything was going to be okay.\n\nNow, I feel a bit hopeless. I know that there are so many other smart people in the world, who are studying the very same things.. But Hawking was uniquely inspiring. His very survival overcame so many odds, not to mention the leaps and bounds he was able to make for the scientific community.\n\nRIP Stephen.",

And it saddens me to no end that this person who changed the entire course of my adult life. And the way I fundamentally look at the world around me. Will never get to hear the endless amount of praise I could bestow upon him. Although I choose to believe that he has heard it enough times to know that he caused a change in so many young people such as myself that he passed on knowing that he had already done a great amount worth engraving into my soul. Thank you Dr. Hawking. I can't say it enough times. Thank you.\n\nEdit: I failed English 4 times. As I'm sure you can see.",

It makes me really depressed that people like her has that opinion of a man who made awesome contributions to this world. I believe we need more Hawkings and less fanaticism.",

He dedicated all of that time, and that life to doing what he loved and trying to improve the world.

I want to spend more time pursuing my dreams and improving the world around me, I want to adventure and I want to make myself and others smile a lot more often. For the first time in what seems like a very long time, I can confidently say I am happy to be alive.\n\nThis came to mind while writing this and in a lot of ways reminds me of Stephen Hawking: Final C&H strip",

                "comment": "Probably going to get buried but I got some feelings to get out so here:\n\nWhen I was eleven, I wanted to be an astrophysicist. Stephen Hawking was an indispensable reason as to why. When I was twelve, I got picked on for reading his books at school. For my thirteenth birthday, I received tickets to attend one of his lectures at McCaw Hall in Seattle. Even though he was bound to a wheelchair, shortly after that event he was scheduled to go on a zero gravity flight, saying \"I want to show that people need not be limited by physical handicaps as long as they are not disabled in spirit.\" Though my interest in astrophysics and cosmology has waned, Hawking's example of perseverance, and passion for his field of study, kept me searching for my own niche to which my work belongs.\n\nSome of his most influential work proposed that even when something was lost to a black hole, it wouldn't be entirely gone; it's information would still be preserved and radiated out from where it was lost.\n\nIn the same way, there is now a vacuous space among the most influential people of our time. Even though a once-in-a-generation mind and individual have departed, the work of Stephen Hawking will be distributed and enable the next generation of discovery. Wherever we, as a species, arrive in the coming centuries, it will be at least in part due to this man.",

Still with all of those, I\u2019m still interested in physics, space, molecules, atoms, gravity.... I just find these topics so interesting.

One of my goals in life was to meet the man who lit the fire of scientific investigation of the universe within me. I'm truly upset to see such an amazingly inspirational man leave this world.

We face awesome environmental challenges: climate change, food production, overpopulation, the decimation of other species, epidemic disease, acidification of the oceans.\n\nTogether, they are a reminder that we are at the most dangerous moment in the development of humanity. We now have the technology to destroy the planet on which we live, but have not yet developed the ability to escape it. Perhaps in a few hundred years, we will have established human colonies amid the stars, but right now we only have one planet, and we need to work together to protect it.\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/stephen-hawking-dangerous-time-planet-inequality",

I just looked over at his AMA on AI, and am immediately impressed and inspired to contribute. There alone is his personal contribution to our society: inspiration of theoretical sciences (and academia in general, I suppose).\n\nI may be nobody, but I only wished he expounded upon his responses with greater insight on AI and in what forms we may expect it to generate and operate from. Regardless, his sentiment is the same grave warning that is perpetuated subliminally and directly by core, influential members of our society: AI is dangerous but wonderful; it invokes our imagination and curiosity. I think this is akin to the Biblical teaching of Adam and Eve taking/eating from the Tree of knowledge of good and evil. We have been warned through time about certain pursuits.\n\nI have not been blessed with the requisite knowledge to comment or speculate in detail. I only feel we should be careful and exercise our minds more or collaborating with other individuals rather than leaning so much on technology to answer our questions.",

They will always make me question what exactly existence is.\n\nWhat I find most uncanny about this beautiful creature, is that what he said all made sense to me. He made sense of my thoughts. He legitimized my silly failed-highschool-science. Until the end, he dared me to think outside the box - tools I have used to great success in my (non-scientific) career and life in general. And for this, I thank him on a personal level.\n\nAlso, what a smartass. Legitimizes my smartassery, hopefully.\n\nCheers to the most intelligent creature that will ever likely grace this beautiful planet at the same time I will. Pour one for your dead homies <3",

His genius was math, otherwise he was just another intelligent human with an outlook imposed on him by a condition he had no control over. I don\u2019t begrudge his ideas, they\u2019re reasonable to have and definitely well thought out.\n\nBut the part I hated was how the media would treat him like some kind of genius prophet, and \u201cscience enthusiasts\u201d would take everything he said as Gospel truth simply because it came from him. What\u2019s worst, it was usually an off-the-cuff answer to a probing question when Hawking himself wanted to talk about other things.\n\nSo, R.I.P. Stephen. A genius, but also a man.",

In a lot of small ways, A Brief History of Time has changed my life by allowing me to reassess myself, my issues, my thoughts, and my worldview from a very genuine, impactful standpoint. That may never have been Hawking's intention but the value of that book extends so far beyond just science.",

Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly.\"",

Each is a sophisticated instrument requiring teams to operate, each with it's own idiosyncrasies which needed to be accounted for during the reconstruction process. I seriously doubt that a single human could comprehend the full stack in sufficient detail to reproduce this result by themselves.\n\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_EHT",

All of the scattering and attenuation that has occurred over that vast gulf of time and distance means that even something bigger than solar system scale is bound to look fuzzy. It's such an astounding thing to be able to detect and resolve this at all.\n\nI say energy, because I don't think this uses light from the visible spectrum, so you wouldn't see this directly, it's more of a visual representation than a photograph.",

Einstein's discovery of special relativity came from the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment.\n  \n    In fact, special relativity isn't really the incredible discovery we sometimes make it out to be. It was a sort of \"pregnant\" idea in the undercurrents of physics at the time. It has been said in scientific circles that if Einstein hadn't discovered special relativity when he did, another brilliant theoretical physicist would have within the 5 years following.\n  \n    General relativity is the REALLY BIG DEAL. If every other scientific discovery we'd made to that point was a shiny golden apple, there'd be a mountain of them. GR in that analogy would be a giant watermelon added to the pile. It doesn't fit at all with any previous ideas or knowledge. Its a serious outlier.\n  \n    Einstein was brilliant beyond words, and he's responsible for so much of the science of the last 100 years+. But the discovery of GR is so huge... its such an incredible leap forward that we all STILL sit around and marvel at its staggering insight into the nature of reality.\n  \n    And THAT is the theory that started out as a freaking thought experiment!!! It took years and a lot of hard work to get the first simple confirmations, and over the decades the harder we looked for proof, the stronger those equations became.\n  \n    General Relativity is probably mankind's greatest achievement in pure knowledge. And it all started with Einstein just chewing on an idea.\n  \n  \n      ",

Or more correctly, they wanted to detect the \"aether\" (a proposed medium for light) light moved through, which was the main conjecture at the time.\n\nShockingly, they didn't find any evidence for an aether. And they found out that the speed of light was always constant. From that, Einstein's theories are the only thing that really makes sense. With a universal speed limit so to speak, something else have to give way. Time and velocity (but not acceleration or force) depends on the reference frame of the observer, but the speed of light is always the same for all observers.",

He said the moment of that realization was \"like a storm breaking in his mind.\"\n\nConversely if you were in an elevator in outer space that was accelerating at 9.81\u00a0m/s2, you will never be able to know, by experiments alone, whether you are sitting still on earth, or are accelerating in outer space.\n\nTherefore it follows that gravity is acceleration. I.e. there is a physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding\u00a0acceleration of the reference system.\n\nThis became known as the equivalence principle.",

You do similar things (albeit on a smaller scale) all the time, otherwise, you would either go insane or have absolute no knowledge of reality.\n\nAll he did was look at the patterns and imagine a general rule that describes what he was seeing. You do it all the time, just not on as grand of a scale. Einstein always said that imagination is most important aspect of what he did. He merely used his imagination on something larger than you normally do.\n\nI bet if you tried, you could come up with some ground-breaking observations too. I doubt that you could transcribe what you observed into formulas, but assuming a reasonable amount of intelligence, that can be taught.",

                                "comment": "General relativity is one thing. That's just an analysis of the comparative speed of objects.\n\nLike, imagine you're floating out in space and you see someone else float by at 5 mph. Now, are YOU going 5 mph, or are they? Are you both just travelling 2.5mph in opposite directions? Without a frame of reference there's simply no way to know.\n\nThat's general relativity.\n\nNow, SPECIAL relativity is a different beast. Because light does not work the way I described above. If I'm floating in space and a light beam passes at 5 mph (not the speed of light but for the sake of argument), that relative speed never changes no matter what my movement is.\n\nIf I speed up to 5mph to follow the light, the light will STILL be moving away at 5mph. If I go 5mph in the opposite direction, the light will STILL be moving away at 5mph. So what gives??\n\nWell, Einstein was the first physicist to have the BALLS to suggest that TIME is what gives. We all assumed, for good reason, that time was constant. It is not. Time is a construct of the speed of light and the relative speed of the observer, and it fluctuates.\n\nHe then deduced the rest once he landed on that truth.",

It's usually called Galilean relativity.\n\nBecause Einstein's General Relativity is a completely utterly different beast compared even to his Special relativity. The math to describe it is immensely more complex (all you essentially need to mathematically describe special relativity is Pythagoras' theorem) and the implications completely crazy. Black holes are one of those. They sounded so crazy that Einstein himself refused to believe such a thing could exist in reality.",

The fact that Reddit decided to implement these changes in the first place, without thinking of how it would negatively affect these communities, which provide a lot of value to Reddit, is even more worrying.\n\nIf this is the direction Reddit is going, I want no part of this. Reddit has decided to put business interests ahead of community interests, and has been belligerent, dismissive, and tried to gaslight the community in the process.\n\nIf you'd like to try alternative platforms, with a much lower risk of corporate interference, try federated alternatives like Kbin or Lemmy: r/RedditAlternatives\n\nLearn more at:\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762792/reddit-subreddit-closed-unilaterally-reopen-communities",

John Michell wrote in a letter:\n\n\"If there should really exist in nature any bodies, whose density is not less than that of the sun, and whose diameters are more than 500 times the diameter of the sun, since their light could not arrive at us; or if there should exist any other bodies of a somewhat smaller size, which are not naturally luminous; of the existence of bodies under either of these circumstances, we could have no information from sight; yet, if any other luminous bodies should happen to revolve about them we might still perhaps from the motions of these revolving bodies infer the existence of the central ones with some degree of probability, as this might afford a clue to some of the apparent irregularities of the revolving bodies, which would not be easily explicable on any other hypothesis; but as the consequences of such a supposition are very obvious, and the consideration of them somewhat beside my present purpose, I shall not prosecute them any further.\"\n\nSo there you go, one more for the \"he would have been really happy to see this\" list.",

It wasn't accepted as a generic thing in GR until the 1960s. The first black hole was observed in the early 1970s, but due to it being in a binary system with a star there was a decent amount of doubt in the scientific community at the time.\n\nIn 1916 Swarzschild found his solution to GR that predicted black holes, but it was seen as a mathematical curiosity rather than a physical thing. Anyone familiar with GR and black holes is familiar with his name and work, because his work is still used and quite a few things are named after him, but it took over 40 years for it to be tied to reality.\n\nGR research really took off in the 1950s in general. That's how far ahead of its time GR was. SR, by comparison, was more like combining the work already done.\n\nGravitational waves have an even more convoluted history with Einstein himself flip flopping and getting a few things wrong due to not understanding the math of his own theory. Not to knock Einstein, because GR was at least a generation ahead of its time and one of the, if not the, biggest leaps forward in known scientific history. I just feel it's important to point out all people have strengths and weaknesses, and that all of the \"legends\" of yesteryear were people.\n\nPrior to 1958 there were certainly ideas about objects in space we could not observe, but they didn't have the same qualities of black holes.",

A theory in science is the highest degree of certainty there is, above laws or hypothesis.\n\" The meaning of the term scientific theory (often contracted to theory for brevity) as used in the disciplines of science is significantly different from the common vernacular usage of theory.[4][Note 1] In everyday speech, theory can imply an explanation that represents an unsubstantiated and speculative guess,[4] whereas in science it describes an explanation that has been tested and widely accepted as valid. These different usages are comparable to the opposing usages of prediction in science versus common speech, where it denotes a mere hope. \"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory",

This image was taken using radio telescopes positioned across the entire earth and formed by stitching together petabytes of data until an accurate and coherent image of the black hole was formed. The redish yellow in the image is the light surrounding the event horizon and the black dot in the middle is the actual black hole.",

Some of the other observations are most likely more high level. The fact that black holes exist, which is confirmed by this image is already a big deal, since in physics you can never truly accept anything until things have been confirmed with mountains of evidence.",

It matches how the models predicted it would look. This means that, more or less, our understanding of the physical laws of the universe are accurate. To top it off, Einstein predicted that black holes were possible and existed over 100 years ago, and it is FINALLY confirmed.\n\nEdit: I forgot that a few months ago, LIGO caught two black holes smashing into each other, but this is super important in seeing how theories match up with...lets call it reality",

To this end, we construct a large library of models based on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic(GRMHD)simulations and synthetic images produced by general relativistic ray tracing. We compare the observed visibilities with this library and confirm that the asymmetric ring is consistent with earlier predictions of strong gravitational lensing of synchrotron emission from ahot plasma orbiting near the black hole event horizon. The ring radius and ring asymmetry depend on black hole mass and spin, respectively, and both are therefore expected to be stable when observed in future EHT campaigns. **Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a spinning Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. **\n\nEmphasis mine. It's this that makes Einstein's work amazing. For us to be able to predict such a specific detail about black holes (that we only knew it was possible to exist due to his work in the first place) and even this detail is also expected due to his work.\n\nYeah, GR predicted black holes, in theory, decades later we found out they do exist through indirect observation. GR mathematical models applied to simulations predict an asymmetry in the accretion disk, decades later after when we finally manage to picture a black hole what do we get? An asymmetry in the accretion disk.\n\nIt's just simply amazing, especially taking into account how little we knew about the universe when he created this theory.",

They kept coming up with the same number even when they were moving towards/away from the source (I.e. light from the sun during dawn and dusk.). They kept coming up with weirder and weirder theories to explain it.\n\nEinstein comes along and says \"maybe light is the same speed no matter what.\"\n\nThe implications are really weird. For that to be true, basically space and time need to warp to get that to work. Time literally slows down when you move quickly. One person can look at another guy moving away and say \"time is moving shower for him than for me\" while the other guy looks back and says the exact same thing, and they're both right.\n\nSo when we say it takes a certain crazy genius to look at all that, and say, \"this makes more sense than any common sense/life experience tells us\" and come up with all the equations to make it work properly, we really mean a crazy genius.\n\nAnyways, one of the implications is that since light is always moving in a straight line at the speed of light regardless of what the person experiencing it is doing, then experiencing acceleration is extra weird. If you're in a box accelerating upwards and light moves horizontally across the box, you'll see it bend.\n\nBut what's the difference between a guy in a box feeling acceleration due to a rocket, and a guy in a box feeling acceleration due to gravity?\n\nRelativity: nothing.\n\nLight will bend due to gravity just like it will due to being in a box that's accelerating.\n\nThe implication of that is that gravity itself warps space.\n\nYou take that to extremes - what if something has so much gravity that it warps space that light goes in a full circle? Or even more, causing it to spiral inwards? At that point you have black holes and even crazier stuff I don't understand.",

When it didn't work, they then enabled it. The best source I can find for this second hand information:\n\nhttp://www.leapsecond.com/history/Ashby-Relativity.htm\n\nAt the time of launch of the first NTS-2 satellite (June 1977), which contained the first Cesium clock to be placed in orbit, there were some who doubted that relativistic effects were real. A frequency synthesizer was built into the satellite clock system so that after launch, if in fact the rate of the clock in its final orbit was that predicted by GR, then the synthesizer could be turned on bringing the clock to the coordinate rate necessary for operation. The atomic clock was first operated for about 20 days to measure its clock rate before turning on the synthesizer. The frequency measured during that interval was +442.5 parts in 1012 faster than clocks on the ground; if left uncorrected this would have resulted in timing errors of about 38,000 nanoseconds per day. The difference between predicted and measured values of the frequency shift was only 3.97 parts in 1012, well within the accuracy capabilities of the orbiting clock. This then gave about a 1% validation of the combined motional and gravitational shifts for a clock at 4.2 earth radii.\n\nedit: source with plots of the effect of relativity correction by hours:\n\nhttps://ia800803.us.archive.org/16/items/DTIC_ADA058591/DTIC_ADA058591.pdf",

                                "comment": "Okay, here's the problem. Einstein's General Relativity (GR) has passed every experimental test we have thrown at it. It's even enabled us to do things that would be impossible without understanding how space and time are related. The best example is GPS. There are details elsewhere, but essentially GPS calculations need GR corrections to be accurate. So, all well and good.\n\nThere's another big theory out there called Quantum Mechanics (QM). There's a bunch of different variants, of which Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the latest and greatest. QM and QFT give us everything we know about the subatomic realm. Understanding radioactive decay, building nuclear reactors, maybe building fusion reactors, even designing very very fast modern CPUs depends on QM. QFT has also passed every test thrown at it. One test even verified its predictions down to seventeen decimal places. Put another way, if QM could be used to predict the distance between New York and Paris, the prediction would agree with reality to within the width of a human hair. So, very good.\n\nNow the problem - one of these theories is wrong. That is, QM and GR are incompatible. If we try to combine concepts from QM into GR, the equations sort of explode. If we try to include GR into QM, we get QFT. If we try to fully incorporate GR into QFT, QFT explodes. And if we try to apply GR, QM or QFT to extreme areas such as inside a black hole, the answers are very confusing; GR divides by zero and QM goes in the corner and cries. QFT works right up until the edge, we think, but only by applying Stephen Hawking level cleverness. Seriously, Hawking radiation was discovered when Stephen Hawking got very clever with boundary conditions and an early variant of QFT.\n\nSo something's broken, and we don't know what. What we need is the ability to look at where reality disagrees with our GR and QFT predictions. The problem is that both theories are absurdly accurate for anything that's not a black hole or big bang. We can't find a break to use to figure out what we should do.\n\nSo aside from the sheer technical accomplishment of this image, we now have the ability to directly observe the one area we know that all these theories do not behave correctly. If we look long enough, we hope we will be able to see where one of these theories makes a prediction that isn't what we observe. Then the fun really starts.",

It has nothing to do with how a black hole would appear from millions of light years away. That is the domain of GR alone. And as the person you replied to stated, the properties of matter and energy on which the black-hole-appearance predictions are founded have already been proven. The predicted appearance is wholly derivative. It's not as if the appearance of a black hole is a unique way of testing something that's never been tested before.

                "comment": "Radio astronomer here! This is huge news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, see stars orbit them, etc) and another to actually get a friggin' image of one. Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!\n\nNow what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the event horizon, which is basically the \"point of no return\" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is not actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in. In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own Sag A*.\n\nNow, on a more fundamental level than \"it's cool to have a picture of a black hole,\" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on. First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR. Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a gravitational singularity, where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity. We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how relativistic jets get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions. Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have direct imaging of an event horizon? It's priceless!\n\nThird, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly hard and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done. I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement. Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- that is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon. To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data. This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)\n\nA final note on that- why M87? Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy? Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve. Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at \"only\" 25,000 light years away. M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 times bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole. This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years). The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\n\nAnyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation! It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!\n\nTL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do. Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.\n\nEdit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today. Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract. It's not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.",

Basically ELI'm a liberal arts-educated functional normal person.\n\nIs the density treated as a zero sum situation? Like once matter splats onto it, it's just there and the density of the whole ball is treated uniformly? Or is it treated more like an exponential spectrum of density, approaching infinity as you approach the center of the mass? In this I would imagine that as the center's density (and therefore gravity) increases, matter at each successive atomic/subatomic level would settle into thinner and thinner layers. Like how a bigass snow pile can be basically solid ice at the bottom but fresh powder on the top, with the ice part getting denser and thicker as more snow packs on at the top.\n\nOr the gravitational force is so strong that matter no longer consumes the same volume of space it otherwise would? If that's the case my brain hurts",

Once the critical mass slid reached beyond the event horizon all futures lead to the singularity, the event horizon flips the world from space like\u201d to timelike. What I find strange is that most things, like gravity, diminish to the cube root (due to 3 dimensions) but the surface of a black hole encodes all the information contained meaning it only scales as a square- it\u2019s counterintuitive and implies our entire universe exists on a boundary at the edge of the universe and we are a projection of that.",

We call these radio telescopes because they 'see' large radio waves.\n\nIn this we aren't using a single radio telescope - we're using eight of them simultaneously. The combined results from all eight sources is what gives us the resolution we need to image these black holes at all - even though they are very large they are also incredibly far away. These are direct observations, though - this isn't the 'gravity wobble' observation we use to detect exoplanets around other stars.",

So the waves wouldn't be visible to our eyes.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47873592\n\nProf Falcke had the idea for the project when he was a PhD student in 1993. At the time, no-one thought it was possible. But he was the first to realise that a certain type of radio emission would be generated close to and all around the black hole, which would be powerful enough to be detected by telescopes on Earth.\n\nHe also recalled reading a scientific paper from 1973 that suggested that because of their enormous gravity, black holes appear 2.5 times larger than they actually are.\n\nThese two previously unknown factors suddenly made the seemingly impossible, possible.",

The answer is yes: you should see something similar to this image from any angle.\n\nHere's my (layman's) understanding of it: If you imagine looking at a black hole with a flashlight behind it being shone in your direction, some of the light will fall into the black hole, but some will race around it's horizon. After it passes near the horizon it will continue as light does, some of it towards you, the observer. That light is effectively what you are seeing, and the shadow in the center is the result of those photons that did not make it around the horizon.",

Got the PhD and now living in Germany doing a data science job. I miss it! But it's neat to try something new :)",

This wikipedia article is short and not too technical: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet.\n\nMore to the question your asking though, jets from a black hole are formed and ejected entirely outside of the event horizon. Also, the matter/gasses around a black hole will gather in an accretion disk, while the jets are ejected along the poles. An accretion disk is probably essential in the process creating the jets, since it will be the source of energized matter.",

However, it might be that because of extreme time-dilation due to the gravity that this total collapse takes the age of the universe to happen. Though only moments for the collapsing object itself (which, from it's \"view\" the universe would pass in a blink).",

From what I understand of with Hawking radiation, virtual particles form with an unknown mechanism throughout space time and some on both sides of a black hole event horizon.\n\nTypically the two pair (as described currently) particle and anti-particle pair pop into existence and then recombine virtually instantaneously; with exception to the event horizon scenario where one particle falls to the singularity and the other does not. This was how Hawking explained the phenomenon of black holes shrinking over a very, very long time; even by astronomical time scales.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m just an armchair layman on theoretical physics. I also enjoy learning about the field of quantum physics and QED, QFT and blackholes end up in that realm to my untrained theories on this stuff.

I took an introductory astronomy course in uni so I am fairly uneducated in the matter but I am curious about black holes.\n\nWhy do you think those jets don't escape in every direction of the black hole and only escape on one axis (like the Y axis for example, on one plane). If the black hole really is a sphere, then why not shoot those jets out in every possible direction like how light emits from the sun?\n\nWhy are those jets emitted from some black holes? I assume that isn't known yet but is there some theory that scientists have to explain that?\n\nFollow up question, why is a black hole spherical, yet it bends spacetime with its density that depicts a hole? Could this bending in spacetime explain why those jets occur?\n\nI want to clarify my understanding of the image of the black hole. Due to the event horizon being the point of no return, you can't really see the black hole itself, you just see the event horizon. This is true?\n\nI've spoken to my dad to some extent on this subject because he is obsessed with astronomy (reads articles on astronomy nearly every night haha). He has a theory that the jets that spew out of the black hole could somehow regenerate the universe as they spew out matter back into space since black holes can't hold everything in them. Could that be possibility?",

When a layman thinks of a hole, they think of something hollow where things can pass through. Black holes have mass, which means it might not be hollow. Instead of passing through, matter gets absorbed. Could we have called it something more appropriate and unappealing like maybe a black sponge?",

'Sucking' here is of course not an accurate way of talking about, but the point is that the sun and moon effect the path of light just like black holes... they bend the line that light would travel through. That's what physicists mean when they talk about 'curving' or 'bending' space-time... the path light would travel unencumbered in 'free' space is altered by energy (including mass a la E = mc2) according to general relativity, resulting in a curved path instead of a straight line. In the case of black holes those paths can become circular (aka a stable orbit) or spiral inwards to the singularity where no one could ever detect it. That photon would not interact with any matter outside of the event horizon and be 'lost' to use. 'Nobody thinks black holes are holes' is just... wrong? semantics? They are called black holes for a reason!",

However, if mass in going in, but the radius doesn't increase... then what is happening to the mass?\n\nAs far as the galactic-center holes go, it seems like they must be accumulating mass. So, probably not a good candidate for flying a spaceship into, hoping for a \"portal\". ;) Then again, maybe it depends on some internal \"ring\" topology, and matter falling in mostly becomes part of the ring, but entering at the poles takes a path through the center and... oblivion? Or infinity and beyond!\n\nAnyway, between the time-dilation and gravitational tidal effects I don't expect black-holes to be very practical means of travel!",

For each N number of telescopes the resolving power increases N squared.\n\nfuture data analysis will be done on higher wavelength signals that will improve resolution.\n\nFurther, getting telescopes that are further out on the edge of the planetary \"dish\" (like the polar regions) will also improve the ability to resolve the image more than equatorial scopes.",

But this image is of such low resolution that any single pixel uncertainty could make the image unusable. This is like taking a photo of pluto with a bright star behind it to gain better resolution of the radius of the planet etc. Its still only like 40 pixels.\n\nI think this is cool, but being that it 'confirms' or doesnt upset the GR models, its expected.\n\nI was way more excited about the LIGO data, because radio telescopes are being outclassed in terms of their reach.",

We know that the mass resides within a single point, rather than within some three-dimensional volume, due to the observable effects of gravity (and et cetera) outside of the event horizon? Put another way, if all that mass was within a volume of a sphere a few meters across, would we be able to observe (or model) phenomena around a black hole that would be different than if all the mass is within a singularity?",

If you orbited (walked around) the lion, the perspective would change, to his nose sticking out, to just the back of his mane. I assume that the black hole appears like the photo regardless of angle, since the gravity is sucking in the photons that would normally reach your eye (or imagine device)?\n\nIf so, that makes this object something amazingly unique - a \"hole from every angle\". Something massively counter-intuitive to anything we've looked at in our lives.",

Whenever any mathematical model results in a singularity, it's a good indication that you're just using the model beyond it's bounds, rather than it portraying anything physical.

Since the picture basically verifies that Einstein's theory of General Relativity is correct, how does it contritubute to \"new\" understanding of relativity? To me, it seems that the equations we have been using were indeed correct, so therefore nothing should change our current understanding of relativity.

Please bear with me because I am most certainly a layman.\n\n1: is this picture....actually a picture? I ask because it's my understanding that often when it comes to astronomy photographs arnt usually the same as the ones you or I would take of our family with the phone but rather a sort of artistic rendering based on complicated data. Basically a computer saying \"according to all our numbers and formulas, this is what we think X looks like\"\n\nGranted modern digital photos are all technically renderings of data but I don't think it's quite a fair comparison because the more celestials ones have more gaps filled in by guess work and equations.\n\n2.This is just a random silly question about black holes in general, but scifi oftens showcases a black hole as being....well a \"hole\" (like a much more intense version of a wormhole, which itself is similar to a portal) But I've often wondered if, based on the idea of intense gravity at work, a black hole is essentially a giant dark sphere of mass. We only call it a hole because we can't see it but essentially it just crushes all matter nearby until said matter becomes a part of the black hole itself.\n\nSo if someone were an all powerful god, they could grab a sun or any star in their hand like a ball. It's density would make it a firm object as opposed to a more gas or ball of fire idea.\n\nIs it possible or even likely that the same is true of a black hole? And if one were an all powerful god, the black hole would be like a giant dark ball in their hand. Or would be more like a hole they could put their hand into?",

Like the whole journey. Of course the light isn't bending, the spacetime that the light travels at a constant through is so warped that you can see the journey of it going \"around\" the back of the black hole as if it were just circling it as a flat plane facing you, and you would see this from any angle.\n\nStanding in the right spot (assuming you could survive) you could see the back of your own head in front of you because the way spacetime gets warped around black holes. It's really bizarre and honestly kinda terrifying.",

But, it turns out, it was easier to image M87\u2019s monster. That black hole is 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo, about 2,000 times as far as Sgr A*. But it\u2019s also about 1,000 times as massive as the Milky Way\u2019s giant, which weighs the equivalent of roughly 4 million suns. That extra heft nearly balances out M87\u2019s distance. \u201cThe size in the sky is pretty darn similar,\u201d says EHT team member Feryal \u00d6zel.\n\nDue to its gravitational oomph, gases swirling around M87\u2019s black hole move and vary in brightness more slowly than they do around the Milky Way\u2019s. \u201cDuring a single observation, Sgr A* doesn\u2019t sit still, whereas M87 does,\u201d says \u00d6zel, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \u201cJust based on this \u2018Does the black hole sit still and pose for me?\u2019 point of view, we knew M87 would cooperate more.\u201d",

Seeing one \u201cis a Herculean task,\u201d she said.\n\nThe significance is that we just took a picture of something 50 million light-years away that also absorbs light, and as such is essentially invisible to us. Every depiction of a black hole you've ever seen so far (film, media, digital renders, etc.) was someone's interpretation of what one would look like, whereas this is the real deal.",

It'd be pitch black if you could see it, as the gravitational field is strong enough to make the escape velocity (speed required to get away from the black hole) at the event horizon greater than the speed of light, which means light can't escape and literally anything within that region can only move closer toward the geometric center of the black hole.\n\nThe bright matter around it is all the matter that is very close to falling in, and is heated by friction as it inspirals in.\n\nIt's significant because we've never resolved the event horizon like this in an image before.\n\nI imagine it's brighter on one side as the accretion disk will be spinning so fast that the side spinning towards us is blueshifted and the side rotating away is redshifted, although I'm not an astronomer and that may be wrong.",

Since that matter hasn't yet gone past the point of no return, you can still see it (see light bouncing off of it).",

So from inside the EH you would see all the light from the universe behind you, compressed collapsing into a single point as you get closer to the singularity",

The picture was taken via multiple satellites aimed at a point in the sky over 50,000,000 light years away. Really amazing achievement",

The only reason the terms are named that way is because in the visible spectrum, \"red\" has a longer wavelength than \"blue\". In reality, the data captured by telescopes probably extend past what is actually visible but the concept of longer and shorter wavelengths still holds true. Objects far away will emit longer wavelengths of light (more red-shifted).\n\nI would recommend reading articles on this kind of imaging though if you want to learn more. I'm not a physics guy.",

Room temperature is about 300 K and the surface of the sun is about 5000 or 6000 K. (Kelvin is the same units as Celsius but add 273 to the number.)\n\nMatter with a temperature warmer than absolute zero is always \"glowing\". It's only when stuff is warmer than a certain temperature, about 800 K, that it glows in the wavelengths of visible light and starts to turn bright red to our eyes. Night vision for example is a camera that makes a picture of 'light' from wavelengths that correspond to human body temperature, probably in the infrared spectrum which has less energy than the color red. Blue is the high energy end of visible light. This is the same concept as how light bulb color from red to yellow-ish to bright white is rated in temperature--Kelvin. A campfire or candle giving off very red light is low temperature, like 1000 K. The mid-day sun bright white and almost blueish is about 5000-6000 K.\n\nAt hotter temperatures stuff is glowing hotter than white-hot. The object works its way up the E-M spectrum into shorter wavelengths. Really hot stuff will glow in the wavelengths of X-rays and then gamma rays.\n\nThe other part is: You know you when a truck or ambulance or something goes by, it has a higher pitch as it approaches but then flips to a lower pitch as soon as it passes you and is moving away? This is the Doppler Effect. When the truck is moving toward you the sound waves \"sound\" to have a higher pitch or a shorter wavelength because the speed of the truck adds onto the sound wave and the opposite happens when the truck is moving away from you.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation (light, radio waves, x-rays, infrared, ultraviolet, etc) does that too, but the object has to be going really fast. This is how the expansion of the universe is measured--light from distant stars is \"red shifted\" similar to the sound of the truck horn being lower pitched as it speeds away from you. Rather than the sound being higher or lower, motion affects light by stretching or compressing the light tinting it bluish or reddish. Far away stars that the expanding universe is pulling away from us \"look\" redder than they should be. If a star was speeding toward us, it'd appear bluer than it should be.\n\nIn the case of the gas orbiting the black hole, the gas is going so insanely fast. It's probably going most the speed of light so it's very hot and energetic so it's glowing so incredibly hot. On top of that, it's moving incredibly fast. From the scale the wavelength on the bright side as it whips around toward us appears to correspond to a temperature of 5-6 billion K. On the side whipping away from us, the wavelengths correspond to a temperature of only 1-2 billion K. So really if it's 6 and 2 billion K, that'd mean the gas is like 4 billion K all the way around but it's moving so fast that the Doppler Effect is altering the apparent temperature by a factor of like 50%.",

The part of the accretion disk rotating toward us will have a higher photon flux headed towards earth than the part rotating away. We see this as a brighter patch where the disk is rotating toward us. This is relativistic brightening and dimming. This is in addition to the blue-shifts and red-shifts (Doppler shift)!\n\nSource: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0f43",

WHSSSSSSSSSSsssshhoooooo\n\nThat happens because when it's coming towards you, the sound waves are squished together, increasing their frequency, and the opposite happens when it is travelling away-- they're stretched out, giving them a lower frequency.\n\nEdit: This happens because the sound waves always travel at the same speed. The sound going forward doesn't travel at Mach 1 plus 70mph or whatever, it just goes Mach 1. This makes the sound waves pile up on each other, squishing them closer together. A shorter wavelength directly results in a higher frequency.\n\nThis is called a Doppler shift, and it happens to light beams as well. Things which are approaching look more blue (higher frequency), and which are traveling away look more red (lower frequency). You can use this for all sorts of useful things, like measuring the velocity of water particles in a storm, or the motion of stars and galaxies.\n\nSo if you have a disk which is spinning at nearly light speed, aka an accretion disk, one side shoukd look very blue and the other side will look very red.

Fast enough to go around the planet 7.5 times in one second. It would take 25,000 years to get there.\n\nThe average life span is ~ 70 years.\n\nIt would require ~ 356 life spans going as fast as theoretically possible to get there.\n\nIt's so far away.

Fast enough to go around the planet 7.5 times in one second. It would take 25,000 years to get there.\n\nActually no. You forgot to take time dilation into effect. Remember light itself does not experience time. This is why we talk about spacetime and not space and time.\n\nIn theory if you could travel c it would take no time at all to reach the destination.",

Sagittarius A* data exists but hasn't been processed yet to the same level of detail and will take more time for them to analyse. Whilst Sgr A* is closer, its a thousand times smaller and moving a thousand times faster. It was likened to an analogy of getting a toddler to sit still for 8 hours of photos. The m87 blackhole is enormous and relatively dormant in comparison, so was likely to provide a more striking image visually which is why they focused efforts here first.",

Humans are generally smart enough to trust the smart people, and a larger number of the average/dumb ones seem to be accepting of the facts and theories of the most intelligent of our species. The idiots who believe the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, the earth is only 6000 years old, and that humans cannot cause climate change are in the minority, and polls seem to indicate that this group is shrinking.",

If you take all of the matter orbiting randomly around it and find the average of its momentum, you end up with a single average orbit, right?\n\nWell, since all the bits of matter spiraling into the black hole collide with each other constantly and exchange momentum, they actually physically average out their momentum and naturally fall into a disk within a single orbital plane.\n\nIt's the same process that forms disks from gas & dust clouds as they collapse into galaxies and solar systems.",

Stars sometimes turn into black holes, and they are often surrounded by rings / disks of stuff - like planets and asteroids.\n\nEven if they don't start that way, it turns out that the tendency of a spinning thing is to flatten out. And pretty much everything in space spins. Think of a merry go round - wherever you start on it, once it gets spinning you're pushed toward the edge. Gravity prevents the disk from flying away completely.\n\nThe disks can start out as rocks and other solid things, but get torn apart into gasses by the strong gravity the black hole causes. If this disk of gas is very hot and that heat can't get away, the disk can sometimes get thicker. This is because hot gas expands. It can happen if the gas is made of the right type of stuff.",

I have no idea how much more difficult it might be, but orbits are not perfectly constant, they are constantly in flux as all the gravity wells of a solar system dance around, I imagine there can be a much larger margin of error as orbits drift even a few hundred kilometers from where there were expected, leading to a potentially blurrier image, if you don\u2019t perfectly account for all of the local gravity sources, their momentum, and the discrete impact that they have on earths orbit over the course of the years of data collection. I imagine it\u2019s doable, but I\u2019m sure if it was easy they\u2019d have done it that way instead. But who knows what the future holds as computing power gets better at accurately simulating/modeling more of the complex dynamics of our physical reality.",

Another limit we reach on wave length is that interstellar dust is much more likely to intercept light in smaller wave lengths. So depending on the target you are looking at this could limit arrays like EHT.\n\nThey are currently adding/upgrading telescopes to view light in more rangers so we'll see what happens there.",

In the picture we see it as a difference in brightness.\n\n\u00a0 I imagine the center not being perfectly black is due to how the picture was taken and the fact that there is still a disk there and we see through it. The event horizon itself and beyond it is 100% absolutely light-less (black) since no light can escape (that is be emitted) from it. As for the rest I guess I have some ideas but wouldn't want to answer out of fear of not being 100% correct haha",

So don't take this as 100% the truth buuuut... I saw a video today where a Nottingham University professor said something like \"I can't wait til we know what these artifacts are and whether they are actually part of the image\" - so I take that as a \"thing that we haven't been told yet\". HOWEVER, my personal take is that it's very likely NOT artifacts but actually part of the image. With 2 years of processing (the picture was actually \"taken\" during 2017), and a lot of algorithms going through the data I don't see how a lot of artifacts would remain in the picture, so everything you see should be the real deal imo. That means gaps etc would be irregularities or something. I guess.",

Combined with previous observations of M87\u2019s jet, which show it\u2019s inclined at an angle of 17\u00b0 relative to our line of sight, this tells us that M87\u2019s black hole likely spins clockwise from our point of view, with its spin axis pointed away from us at an angle.\"\n\nSource: https://aasnova.org/2019/04/10/first-images-of-a-black-hole-from-the-event-horizon-telescope/\n\nEdit 2: The answer is actually really exciting and explains why we don't get to see that \"interstellar effect\". Here are predictions based on various angles.

If not, is that because M87 isn't currently jetting or because the spray is invisible? And finally, how are the scientists going to use this image to understand the process that drives the jetting phenomenon?\n\nSomeone please, please, please help me understand this.

Likewise, while the geometric models in the training set (Section 6.1) include emission from a simple extended jet model, none of the Top Set reconstructions from simulated EHT data recover this extended component nor are their recovered compact structure affected by the missing jet components. Furthermore, our fiducial images in all three pipelines do not recover the more realistic faint jet emission in the GRMHD simulation reconstructions in Figure 10. All of these results reinforce the expectation (see Section 4.3) that the current EHT array lacks the short-baseline coverage and dynamic range necessary to recover a faint, extended jet.\n\nSo basically the method used for this image doesn't allow detecting this jet. It shows up on other kinds of images of the same black hole though (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87#/media/File:M87_jet.jpg)\n\nThe angle happens to be sort of similar to the two red splotches in the image, so maybe they're related?",

The reason nothing seems perfectly symmetrical is because first of all that is ionized got gas which is rotating as unimaginable high speeds around it. The picture is taken by multiple observatories that put together pieces of a whole puzzle, the Earth rotates, and a different observatory takes a picture of a different point. The hole itself is utterly black, we should not be able to see it against the black background of space. Ya you can imagine that if we had more point, the image woulda been sharper and more uniform, but it is gas rotating that emits ionized particles, the hole itself wouldn\u2019t be visible without the bright background. And i think yes, the angle from which you look at it but have an impact on the final image",

Due to gravitational lensing, light doesn't travel in straight lines, but curves sharply. Of course, a black hole emits no light, but you can make the same statement of curvature about lines of sight, instead.\n\nSo if you draw a line of sight from a camera to the black hole, the further from the center of the black hole you look, the more your line of sight is bent inward. At the edges if the black hole, it curves so much it goes around the horizon altogether.\n\nThe effect of this is that, if you look at somewhere just beyond where the edge of the event horizon SHOULD be, you will instead be looking at the backside of the horizon. This means that you actually see the entire horizon at once, front and back, with the back stretched and squashed into a ring around the image of the front. Sort of like this projection of Earth's surface.\n\n(More accurately, since light/line of sight can curve around the black hole several times before \"escaping\" you actually see another image of the front again, projected in an even thinner ring around that. And then, outside that, another, thinner image of the back, and then another thinner image of the front, and so on and so forth to infinity.)\n\nThe sum effect of this is that, looking at a black hole, you see what looks like a black disk, that you might think is the event horizon. But in actuality, this disk is far wider then the event horizon.\n\nThat disk is the shadow, and is the dark blob we see in the image from the EHT.",

                        "comment": "Short answer: You're absolutely right that the shadow (the dark part) is where the black hole is \"blocking\" light. However, since light doesn't follow classically straight lines in general relativity, the hole can actually \"block\" more than what's directly behind it. The glowing stuff is gas we can still see because it's a) far away enough for its light to escape, and b) glowing with heat.\n\nLong answer: Picture how a classical shadow is made. We hold up our hand, shine a flashlight at it, and on the other side there's a black hand-shaped spot on the wall. That spot comes from the light that rain straight into our hand on its way to its final destination (the wall.) You can imagine beams of light, each one a little above the last, running into your hand, until finally one makes it just over your pinkie finger. That's the end of the shadow. Only light headed more or less directly at your hand is blocked; light that just barely grazes over hits the wall.\n\nNow consider the same situation with the black hole (say you've got a really big flashlight). The beams that leave your flashlight and head straight for the event horizon, where all light is inevitably eaten, is obviously doomed. That's part of the black spot.\n\nConsider then the light that would've made it just barely over the top of the event horizon. If light was classical, that'd be where the shadow ended. However -- and this is critical -- gravity curves light. Even if the light left your flashlight on a path that would juuust take it over the horizon, the immense gravity of the singularity pulls it off its straight-line path and into its maw. Not just that: light that would classically clear the black hole at quite a height can get pulled back in, sometimes making several orbits around the hole as it spirals inevitably inward. This ends up making the \"shadow\" of the black hole significantly bigger than the event horizon itself. There's a way of seeing this image as both the front and the back of the black hole -- sort of a real-life sphere projection.\n\nEssentially, singularities would make pretty bad finger puppets.",

                        "comment": "Black holes are just that: black. No matter or light can escape them, so there would be nothing to see if you were to look directly at one. The only way to \"see\" them is to put them in front of a light source and look for the shadow as they block some of the light.\n\nAll the red and orange light you see in the new black hole image is coming from matter surrounding the black hole that is glowing. The true image is in radio wavelengths, but it's been displayed in visible wavelengths so that we can actually view it. The dark spot in the center should be just as bright as the rest, but that light was consumed by the black hole before it could reach us. It's the black hole's shadow.\n\nThe only additional complexity comes from the fact that the black hole is so insanely massive that it bends spacetime around it like crazy and strongly pulls light toward it. So a lot of the light you are seeing is not coming from where it appears to be coming from. The light above the hole did not all originate above the hole. Much of it was whirled around the black hole before being launched from above. Even the dark spot in the middle is much larger than the actual event horizon due to the way light gets sucked in. This complex light distortion has been modeled by scientists using the laws of general relativity, and this image appears to confirm that our simulations are highly accurate.",

But the best way to test a theory is to find the most extreme situations possible and see if the model still gives accurate results. A black hole is just about the craziest warping of gravity and spacetime imaginable, so if we can get our models to predict how black holes behave, we can be relatively confident our understanding of general relativity is correct. And initial impressions seem to be that the released image is a very close match to our models.\n\nThat said, it remains possible that some tiny details might be different than our models. This could provide insight into areas of of relativity that we don't quite understand yet, which is obviously highly valuable.",

That light already travelled 50 million years to get here, now all we need is something powerful enough to magnify that light into something we can see. Telescopes can technically be reverse microscopes but the concept is still the same.\n\nThe further away it is, the harder it is to magnify that tiny light, unless it\u2019s an ultra super massive black hole... then even at that distance, we could still see it.\n\nEdit: just to clarify a bit, the light is harder to magnify because there\u2019s so little of it that made it in our direction. That light is 50 million years old (assume the original star disappeared instantly) but If 25 million years of traveling, its blocked by a giant ball of gas for another 25 million years, then we\u2019d never see that star or black hole ever again",

I understand that what we see lit is the material spinning around the accretion disc, I\u2019m just curious as to why it is that angle.",

But because black hole bends the space light travels in, you will see the accretion disk no matter the angle at which you look at the black hole. It's kinda like looking through a bottle of water at something behind it. Depending on the shape of the bottle you might see multiple copies of that something or you can see it from a slightly different angle.",

Like, why is the accretion disk sitting such that we observe a whole ring, rather than at some other angle, like parallel to the telescope, which would show something like a flat line? With light coming at this from essentially all directions, why is it not more of a bright sphere? If I were physically near the black hole, and moved around it from space to view it from different angles, would the disk \"follow\" me so that I always see this sort of cross-section?\n\nThis is the first time I had ever thought of this question. Up until now I always accepted that artist's renderings of black holes might not be perfect (or as accurate as they turned out to be,) but never thought of any other way it could look.",

The gravity is so extreme that it bends light around. Essentially, you're seeing the back of the accretion disk. Why we can't see the front? I assume it's so thin it can't be resolved from this distance, but I don't know. And as to why it gets crushed down into a disk in the first place? I also don't know, but a lot of objects in space tend to do that, so I assume it's a similar process.",

They are a region of space where gravity is too strong for light to escape. If light can't come from there to your eyes, you can't see it.\n\nThe bright bit that forms a ring is called an accretion disk, and is gas and other matter falling into the black hole. Make no mistake, gravity is very strong there, but not strong enough to stop light from the disk from escaping and ultimately reaching us.",

We have since observed things at the centre of Galaxies,by looking at the movement of nearby stars, and calculating the mass of the central object by looking at the orbital trajectories of surrounding large stars. In some cases, these stars clock in at 1/60th light speed, so they're properly booking it.\n\nThis means we knew where to look if we wanted an actual picture.",

Since in this case, the middle of the part behind the black hole (which is visible on both sides) would be the place where it \"starts\" rotating towards us, with the fastest region being at the bottom, and at the middle of the part in front of the black hole, it starts rotating away from us, thus getting darker again. Consequently, the bottom of the projection of the disk we see is bright and the top is dark.\n\nIf we were truly looking at a disk lying flatly in the plane of the picture, there wouldn't be any difference in brightness at all, right?\n\nMaybe I just misunderstood something, would be great if someone could clarify!",

If it is made to look like it's pointing upwards, then wouldn't that bit be invisible to us?\n\nAs for the rest of what you are saying - precisely! That's exactly why I am wondering why the bottom part is bright. When the disk is located horizontally, like it is in many of the pictures/simulations posted here, then the left side is the bright one, as, assuming counter-clockwise rotation when looking from the top of the disk, the part furthest to the back is where the movement to the observer starts, ending at the part furthest to the front. Thus, the brightest part is on the left.",

Essentially there is no matter that is near the event horizon that is not directly visible to an observer at any angle.

FTA (sorry, markdown + A-star makes for some weird formatting)\n\nEHT trained its sights on both M87\u2019s black hole and Sagittarius A *, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. But, it turns out, it was easier to image M87\u2019s monster. That black hole is more than 50 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo, about 2,000 times as far as Sgr A *. But it\u2019s also about 1,000 times as massive as the Milky Way\u2019s giant, which weighs the equivalent of roughly 4 million suns. That extra heft nearly balances out M87\u2019s distance. \u201cThe size in the sky is pretty darn similar,\u201d says EHT team member Feryal \u00d6zel.\n\nDue to its gravitational oomph, gases swirling around M87\u2019s black hole move and vary in brightness more slowly than they do around the Milky Way\u2019s. \u201cDuring a single observation, Sgr A* doesn\u2019t sit still, whereas M87 does,\u201d says \u00d6zel, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \u201cJust based on this \u2018Does the black hole sit still and pose for me?\u2019 point of view, we knew M87 would cooperate more.\u201d",

It's like taking a picture or a mountain. Oh you could talk about the event of the creation, lifetime and erosion of the mountain. But nobody does. And that's because it makes so little sense when the timescale for that is magnitudes beyond the timeframe we'd enjoy the photo, live as individuals or even exist as a species.\n\nAstronomers don't talk about time in this way. Everything we see is \"now\" Laymen get all excited about light from a light-year away being a year old. Astronomers simply collapse or ignore all that. It's all just \"now\". If something changes between today and next week, they don't say 50 million years ago and 50 million years ago plus one week. No. It's last week and this week and 50 million years of distance not time.\n\nNext, back to 55 million years of distance. This has absolutely nothing to do with the lifetime of that galaxy or that black hole.\n\nBlack holes can grow and they can shrink and evaporate. At least that's what we believe from theory and math. These big ones in the center of galaxies tend to grow as things come their way... including sometimes other black holes. But if everyone and everything would just leave them alone they would eventually evaporate. Unfortunately, however, the math suggests the time it would take for that to happen is staggeringly long. Like ten to the power of one hundred in years.",

But, it turns out, it was easier to image M87\u2019s monster. That black hole is 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo, about 2,000 times as far as Sgr A*. But it\u2019s also about 1,000 times as massive as the Milky Way\u2019s giant, which weighs the equivalent of roughly 4 million suns. That extra heft nearly balances out M87\u2019s distance. \u201cThe size in the sky is pretty darn similar,\u201d says EHT team member Feryal \u00d6zel.\n\nDue to its gravitational oomph, gases swirling around M87\u2019s black hole move and vary in brightness more slowly than they do around the Milky Way\u2019s. \u201cDuring a single observation, Sgr A* doesn\u2019t sit still, whereas M87 does,\u201d says \u00d6zel, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \u201cJust based on this \u2018Does the black hole sit still and pose for me?\u2019 point of view, we knew M87 would cooperate more.\u201d",

Even for a tiny black hole the mass of Earth, it would take billions and billions of years to die.\n\nBlack holes only start to evaporate when the energy they absorb is less than the energy they radiate. As the background radiation of space is 2.75K, and supermassive black holes radiate at a temperature of something closer to a nanokelvin. So it won't be until the background temperature of space has dropped significantly due to expansion (as we approach the heat death) that these black holes will start to evaporate.",

As the CMB is around 2.75K, even without any matter falling into a black hole it will still be absorbing more energy than it loses due to the CMB. It won't start losing energy until billions if not trillions or more of years into the future when the expansion of the universe leads to the heat death and the CMB has cooled further due to huge redshifts.\n\nOnce we reach this stage, it would take a small black hole with the mass of Earth billions of years to evaporate.

FTA:\n\nEHT trained its sights on both M87\u2019s black hole and Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. But, it turns out, it was easier to image M87\u2019s monster. That black hole is 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo, about 2,000 times as far as Sgr A*. But it\u2019s also about 1,000 times as massive as the Milky Way\u2019s giant, which weighs the equivalent of roughly 4 million suns. That extra heft nearly balances out M87\u2019s distance. \u201cThe size in the sky is pretty darn similar,\u201d says EHT team member Feryal \u00d6zel.\n\nDue to its gravitational oomph, gases swirling around M87\u2019s black hole move and vary in brightness more slowly than they do around the Milky Way\u2019s. \u201cDuring a single observation, Sgr A* doesn\u2019t sit still, whereas M87 does,\u201d says \u00d6zel, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \u201cJust based on this \u2018Does the black hole sit still and pose for me?\u2019 point of view, we knew M87 would cooperate more.\u201d",

All eight observatories can track Sgr A*, but M87 is in the northern sky and beyond the South Pole station\u2019s sight.\n\nSo we got this picture when the resolution was only about 60% of what it will be when the South Pole Observatory can help out imaging Sgr A*?

Just imagine an object so dense with so much gravity that the light can't escape, then yes we can debate how this huge amount of mass act on the spacetime, if you think about the representation of gravity as depressions created in the spacetime then yes it could create some sort of a hole but it remains a stellar object",

Newtonian works well for medium-scale situations (ie: throwing a ball, launching a rocket) but breaks down on the scale of planets and stars. GR covers a wider range of situations, from microscopic up to the edge of the event horizon (said far at least). However, GR also breaks down at very small scales, where quantum mechanics come into play.\n\nAll of these theories are approximations of reality, albeit extremely accurate ones for given situations. However, none are perfect and cover every conceivable situation. That's why the holy Grail of physics is some kind of grand unifying theory that would resolve the inconsistencies between GR and quantum mechanics.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that just because they don't explain every situation perfectly, does not mean that these theories are \"wrong.\" We know that they are all accurate to a point, because we've tested and used them in practical application (ie: Newtonian physics is accurate to a point, otherwise we couldn't have landed on the moon. And GR is accurate to a point otherwise GPS wouldn't work).",

It is more about science and society in general then about space, but this got me thinking about accuracy in other fields of science.\n\n(Regarding scientific accuracy) This is not directly related to space, but the idea of scientists being absolutely right, makes me feel bad about our society--about how many people could be so against a scientific consensus on a theory that is most likely true. I mean stuff like climate change and vaccines. So I've been horrified about what-ifs. What if the scientific consensus on climate change and vaccines are absolutely spot on? Like what does it say about the anti-science part of our society?\n\n(Regarding scientific confirmation, disbelievers, and causal effects) It makes me cringe at the thought that the majority of scientists agree on climate change but there are so many people who won't give these scientists the benefit of the doubt. It is horrifying to think that the research consensus on climate change could be verified with extreme accuracy in the far future, but then it would be too late or too costly to recover from because we as a tuggle-war society said those scientists were wrong.\n\n(Regarding scientific consensus) But the painful thing is that scientists have some form of a consensus on climate change. It's not that a small chunk of society choose to not trust a few scientist, but that they don't trust a large majority of them. And if scientists turn out to be spot-on in other fields, then it would make me both happy and sad for the reasons I stated.",

But, it turns out, it was easier to image M87\u2019s monster. That black hole is 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo, about 2,000 times as far as Sgr A*. But it\u2019s also about 1,000 times as massive as the Milky Way\u2019s giant, which weighs the equivalent of roughly 4 million suns. That extra heft nearly balances out M87\u2019s distance. \u201cThe size in the sky is pretty darn similar,\u201d says EHT team member Feryal \u00d6zel.\n\nDue to its gravitational oomph, gases swirling around M87\u2019s black hole move and vary in brightness more slowly than they do around the Milky Way\u2019s. \u201cDuring a single observation, Sgr A* doesn\u2019t sit still, whereas M87 does,\u201d says \u00d6zel, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \u201cJust based on this \u2018Does the black hole sit still and pose for me?\u2019 point of view, we knew M87 would cooperate more.\u201d",

Their basic characteristics are very obvious based on that prediction, so we have a good understanding about many of their traits. Others, we may as well know nothing about.\n\nUltimately, they're very mathematically predictable things. You know that the gravity at the event horizon is too strong for light to escape. Since gravity, mass and the radius of the event horizon are all related, learning one will tell you everything about the others.",

This one is 2.4 billion times the mass of the sun, but its radius is only the size of the distance from the sun to Pluto. That sounds very large, but it's also 50 million light years away and it's hard to see things of even that size over those distances.\n\nwhy this one over another?\n\nThis same project also pointed their telescopes at the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*. They haven't shown us the results yet, but since they haven't said it failed, that image is probably still in the works. This one was just another that sounded large and unobstructed enough to be able to image as well. One was probably the other's backup plan.",

I don't think I've ever found a straight answer.\n\nThis picture kind of paints the answer for me, but we only have the one perspective of it.\n\nAre black holes similar to a 2D object? Like a shower drain where matter falls into?\n\nOr is it more like a 3D sphere of mass that's spinning like a sun? If it is a sphere, does it pull in mass from all 360\u00b0 field, or is it more like a sun where it is on a plane of which matter gets pulled in from?\n\nI'm excited for more info on anything astronomical. I just wish I had the drive and time to read any and all information about it.",

The event horizon, which is what we see here, is a sphere, though it's only a mathematical boundary that defines the point at which the escape velocity is lightspeed - it's not like there's anything that's actually there physically.",

If you have a massive enough object, it will bend space so much that you need to travel faster than the speed of light to escape, which is impossible.",

And the 'brighter' areas are coming towards us (so it red shifts or something and looks brighter)?

The photons that escaped your bedroom window are already past Mars, which happened 5 minutes ago, and on their way to Jupiter.\n\nBy the time you wake up in the morning to brush your teeth, it's twice as far away as Pluto. Twice as far.\n\nImagine th at photon' s journey continuing for a a year.\n\nImagine it continuing for 10 years. Constantly clocking 186,000 miles EVERY SECOND\n\nThis photon will continue to travel at that speed for tens of thousands of years. Imagine 10,000 years in the future. Where will the human race be? Will we even still be here? We'll probably look a little different than what we do now, but not by that much.\n\nIndia collided with Asia about 50 million years ago.. Now imagine the same amount of time passing while that photon that left your bedroom window all those millions of years ago was going that fast for that long.\n\nThat's how far it is.\n\nOf course it gets stranger than that. In fact, no time at all will pass for the photon.\n\nAnd the photon isn't really a particle. It's more of a wave...sometimes. it depends on how close you look and how you look at it.",

Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy? Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve. Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at \"only\" 25,000 light years away. M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 times bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole. This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years). The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\"",

Stuff falling toward and into the black hole.\n\nDue to the gravity of the black hole, the closer the object is to the black hole, the slower time goes due to time dilation, right?\n\nIs there a part of the disk, either seen or hypothetical, that has slowed down 50 million years due to time dilation? Therefore time to view =50 million years equals the object slowed down in time 50 million years, and so we are kind of seeing it real time?",

Would a black hole form if it's location was so dense with matter already that all that smashing and combining just creating something so large and dense with pressure just creates the black hole?

Imagine the kind of space laboratory we'll be able to either launch in a decade once SpaceX's Starship starts flying, and they build a cargo variant that can take 100T to L2 which is the same orbital location where JWST will be.\n\nJWST for reference weighs 6.83433 tons.\n\nAnd then imagine the kind of pictures we'll get.\n\nThis is JUST THE BEGINNING boys and girls.

Why this so dificult to achieve? I know things like scape velocity and the fact that black holes dont let the light scape then so, why is this image so special, what method was used this time? And where did the light came from to reach our telescopes this time?\n\nIm asking seriously, pls take me serious!",

This is because they are too far away from us - the closest blackhole is about 20 million trillion km away from us (3000 lightyears) and it would take us 3000 years to get there if we had a rocket ship that could travel at the speed of 300,000 km/s (this is the speed of light, the fastest speed possible in our universe. Unfortunately, the laws of physics do not allow anything to travel faster than this.)",

There's some other effects happening that I won't go into detail but that light is essentially what you're seeing in the image.",

If there's a lot of matter that it interacts with, then the disk will increase in size. If there's no matter for it to interact with, then it'll decrease in size as the accretion disk gets sucked up by the blackhole over time.",

So this is an immage of the direct effects of a black hole. The shadow in the middle is 3.5 times bigger than the event horizon of the black hole itself. In fact, the shadow would be an image of the front sides and back of the black hole multiple times over. It's just, you know, black. It's truly fascinating.",

I mean, don't the planet's orbit in different angles so that sometimes earth is under mars and sometimes it's above, if we imagine there's an up and down that is. So in the case with the black hole, won't stuff come at it from all directions and orbit around it from the direction they came from?\n\nI'm just saying that I would have thought we would just see a big bright ball of mass and not being able to see the hole at all since everything between the hole and us block that view from us. So if I understand you right everything that gets close enough to the black hole levels out and follow the same direction around the \"orb\"? Or would we see this image at whatever direction we looked at it, even from the other side or \"above\" it?",

                "comment": "This is an amazing piece of work. In terms of scientific implications, most importantly it provides us with an accurate measure of the mass of the supermassive black hole. Before this, among multiple estimates, there were two mass estimates of this particular black hole that were inconsistent with each other, modeling using stars predicted a mass of ~6 billion solar masses and modeling using gas predicted ~3 billion, a factor of 2 smaller. This observation confirmed that the mass estimate using stars are correct, implying imperfections in our gas models. Other exciting implications include confirming that supermassive black holes exist (we knew normal black holes exist, we were sort of certain that supermassive black holes exist, and this observation confirms that they indeed exist), verifying that general relativity does work in this extreme condition (supermassive spinning black hole, or a Kerr black hole). We can also get various detailed information such as inclination angle of the accretion disk, the spin rate etc from this observation. In terms of fundamental physics this probably doesn't give us anything new, but come on, it's a picture of a black hole, it's just awesome!",

This image does not stand out at all, let alone resemble anything I've been told would be a black hole.\n\nThis resembles almost exactly what was actually expected for a black hole to look like at a relatively blurry resolution like this. It's even somewhat similar to the one portrayed in Interstellar.\n\nbut why can't this be an eclipse over an object with protruding gasses?\n\nIt's much too large and massive to be a normal solid object and the gasses around it are glowing extremely brightly. The dark spot is wider than our entire solar system, and the gravity causes the orbits of nearby objects to deflect around it.\n\nOr more-so, this is supposedly 50 million light years away, whatever that means. What's to say the way that galaxy works is the same that ours does?\n\nAs far as we can tell (and scientists have tried very hard to check) physics appears to work the same everywhere, there's nothing inherently special about our galaxy or any of the others.\n\nIts interesting to think that we photographed a black hole, but for something we thought wasn't possible to do, this image does not make me believe it is what they say it is.\n\nIt was not thought of as impossible to do, there's nothing to suggest it should be impossible. The image matches closely with what the scientists expected, and observations show the object is as massive and dense as it seems to be.",

Also, something about training it against models we created as well as things we've observed seems like it would prejudice the machine learning model. We've literally never seen one and astrophysical models are prone to being revised after observations.",

Light particles are emitted from the superheated plasma in all directions as the plasma is pulled towards the black hole. The light that is captured by the event horizon is not visible by anybody, and the light particles that don\u2019t head our direction aren\u2019t visible to us, but isn\u2019t there gas being pulled rapidly into the black hole between us and the black hole that has not yet crossed the event horizon, and should thus be emitting light particles in all directions, some of which would be visible by us?\n\nMy understanding is that the gas on the opposite side of the black hole that\u2019s turned to plasma as it is rapidly pulled in emits light, and some of that light is refracted by the effects of the black hole, which is observed in the brighter portions of the recent photo. If this is correct, then shouldn\u2019t there also be gas on our side doing the same thing?",

They have extremely strong gravity, but just like anything else with gravity, there are stable orbits. That's kind of what we're seeing in the image. The ring around it is the last stable orbit before you fall in.\n\nEx: If our sun were to turn into a black hole right now, we wouldn't get sucked in, because it's still the same mass, so we'd continue orbiting as normal (a whole bunch of other bad stuff would happen, but we wouldn't get sucked in).\n\nAlso, this black hole isn't even in our own galaxy. It's 50 million light years away, so there's really no danger. There's a closer one in our own galaxy that they're still working on getting a picture of, but that one's no danger to us either for the reasons I already mentioned.",

Why worry about all that far away stuff when we got all these REAL problems at home?\n\nAnd yet, we have a fusion reactor a million times larger than Earth sitting 8 light minutes away that could send us back to the stone age with a sneeze. There are lumps of dark iron floating around that could take out continents. There's that whole gravity thing going on that we still don't have a good understanding of, but a full accounting would solve our energy issues forever.\n\nThose are three immediate problems that are all directly tackled by this picture. Don't understand the relation? That's fine, there's plenty of educational material out there to help if you want to learn. Something tells me you don't though. You just want to feel good about declaring stuff you don't understand irrelevant. That makes the world a lot simpler after all.",

If you don't trust the method wich created this image, or the people responsible you need to look into it further yourself. I personly don't doubt the image is real.

However, to me the result was a little disappointing.\n\nI think what's more incredible is putting so much importance on something that will never in any meaningful or real way impact any human life, ever. Yes, this photo confirms what we already knew with 99% certainty and already had accurate models to represent, but that's all it does. Was that really worth the effort and resources expended? I mean we are literally cooking ourselves to death on our own planet and we are fixated on something 50 million light years away. Priorities humans, priorities.",

You can search a felon on supervised release, at any time, no consent needed.\n\nI feel like what you are talking about is someone with PRIOR felonies. Which is how it should be. That person has been to prison, and served their time. If you think that their initial pun ishment wasn't harsh enough, campaign to get the laws and sentencing guidelines changed. Dont use a position of power to subvert any legal loophole and keep ducking that person over.\n\nI understand that the police fill a necessary role in our communities. I also see that every Western nation has them, yet we are the only one where people are just afraid of them. When you are driving and see a cop, do you feel safe, or exposed? \"Am I going too fast?\" The policeman role should be reassessed, with less militarization and more training for community outreach.\n\nCops are not soldiers. The war on drugs isn't a real war. You can't fight a war against your own population.",

Right now there is a stigma around art because artists don't usually get paid well so even kids who enjoy art are discouraged from pursuing it by parents who are worried for their future. Being better paid don't just attract greedy candidates but also candidates who do want to do good but are held back by financial concerns of their families for example.",

There was no one to replace him with because science teachers are rare. Science teachers are rare because all other careers with the same education pay more. So Mr.Krune the thrower of chairs at young teens continues to be employed.\n\n(It's been 10 years since the first one and he still does it every now and then. He still has not been replaced, if an art teacher did that they would be out on there ass later that day.)",

What companies may actually suffer from growing weed acceptance?",

Where as the actual drugs often do. Sure, it can sometimes help cut the edge off of some pain and stress, but it's not a miracle drug that removes cancer or inhibits arthritis growth. It's usually an edge case where it helps some people with specific conditions, not a cure-all like leeches and bloodletting supposedly were, so proffering it as such is no better than those.\n\nI'm all for legalizing it, but that post comes off a bit absurd with direct comparison as if it's competition for all the drugs known to mankind, even the highly effective ones.\n\nFrom a later post: \"i'm a musician\"\n\nAs, so not a neuro-scientist or any other kind of doctor. Just your average reddit armchair expert. /facepalm",

For those who might inadvertently wander across this post, what I actually said was:\n\ni'm a musician. I'm well aware of how prolific marijuana use is in my little circle of acquaintances. But if CBD oil, which can treat chronic pain, anxiety, seizures, some forms of cancer/tumors, ADHD, ADD, joint problems, and can also be used as a form of after-surgery relief drug suddenly becomes legal, the pharmaceutical industry stands to lose millions, maybe hundreds of millions, of dollars that won't be made up by just legalizing marijuana and taxing the revenue.\n\nLet me speak clearly- Marijuana isn't illegal because its bad. Marijuana is illegal (and will continue to be illegal) as long as the people who pay to write the rules stand to lose money from the legalization of marijuana.\n\nI also have a problem with the fact that you think money \"trickles down,\" like water in a fountain.\n\nI have witnessed first-hand a great deal of improvement in individuals who have suffered from everything from ADHD to cancer, when they've undergone treatment with CBD oil. Furthermore, the uncles that used to smoke pot daily are all cancer free and the goody-two-shoes uncles are now dying from 40+ years of drinking and a couple decades of being ignored by the office of veteran's affairs. All of this is anecdotal evidence, and I'm sure you'll treat it as such....for better or worse.",

I think it will alleviate a lot of pressure from society. No more \"war on drugs.\" If two people are getting high and one of them ODs, they will be more likely to call someone for help since they wont be breaking a law, and when you go to the hospital and a doctor asks \"have you recently taken any drugs?\" You can be honest and not fear legal trouble. The doctor can just ask if you have an addiction problem and want help with it if you do.",

Even those concerns are completely misplaced, but cheaper isn't something you'll usually see them make.",

There's also racism and poverty issue in France, and in poorer neighborhood with more immigrants family you'd be more likely to be in trouble if the police finds you with drugs.

With good contact, you can find it for a little bit cheaper (at 8\u20ac/g you'd have an very good deal). Quality varies, it'll depend entirely on who's supplying you. If you can find a local grower that's also selling, it's probably the best.\n\nIn France, we also have what we call \"shit\" (we really use the english word \"shit\") which is cut down cannabis resin. Cannabis resin (haschich) itself is very good, but what you'll find on the street is very cut down, so pretty low quality. A gram is around 5\u20ac, and because it's cheaper it's usually more consumed in poorer neighborhood.\n\nDrug tests will depend on your work. Most places don't test, but you'll have to read your work contract to know if you can be subjected to random or periodic tests. Also, if you have a car accident, you'll probably be tested and if you're positive you probably won't be reimbursed and you'll be the one at fault, even if it's not your fault and your last joint was a few days ago.\n\nAvoid smoking a joint in the street, of course. Some bars are somewhat tolerant but most will ask you to smoke your joint a bit farther. You should probably just smoke in a private setting anyway.\n\nYou can find joint paper to roll your joint in every places that sells tobacco (\"bureau de tabac\"), just ask for \"un paquet de slim\" (Not sure outside of France, but in France \"slim\" paper is what's usually used to roll joint, as it's wider and longer than standard rolling papers. Grinders are legal, also, if you need one.\n\nIn France, we almost never smoke pure weed joint : it's expensive, and can be pretty strong if you're not used to. We usually mix weed (or shit) with tobacco, proportion varying.\n\nI guess to find your first contact you'll have to discretely ask around. If you're a student it really won't be hard. If you're in a poorer neighborhood it's also going to be easy to find, but the quality may suffer (and beware of sketchy dealers). If you're working, I guess you'll have to ask around trusty people.\n\nThat's all I can think of. Don't hesitate to ask more questions if you have some :)",

You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.",

I dunno) bribed the government into banning because they were already well established and hemp would destroy the logging business, the government then accepted under the condition that they pay a higher tax on logging to keep the bribe beneficial for both parties.\n\nI can't remember where or when I saw this, but I swear I heard it somewhere.\n\nThere seems to be a lot I don't remember in this post, blame the government!\n\nWhere's my tinfoil hat gone? oh yeah, I'm wearing it",

Not too much though. Overall, it's pretty even now adays. Maybe if we spent time developing similar techniques for hemp, in 20-30 years, it could beat trees/cotton again.",

The strains we use for industrial hemp are members of the same species as what is grown for recreational and medicinal use, indica or sativa, but have been bred to produce more fiber, seed, etc. The plants look very different and cross pollination of hemp to outdoor grown marijuana would reduce the quality of the marijuana.\n\nOther than some hermaphroditic plants, cannabis is not self pollinating and as such it requires both male and female plants to reproduce. In fiber production this is not an issue, as seed may be desired for livestock feed or for an additional market. With recreational or medical strains, you only want the female plants to grow. Pollination decreases the quality of the end product because the female plant puts energy into producing seeds instead of flower.\n\nHere's a good summation of the argument that the fiber and chemical industries had an impact on the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937:\n\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oil-vs-cannabis-why-marijuana-became-illegal-and_us_592d8b54e4b0a7b7b469cd4d",

In practice, the us government has been bought out by companies on all levels.\n\nFor context, I'm a free market guy, though I lean more towards consumer side economics (the shocking radical theory sometimes called socialist by people who don't understand what socialism and command economies actually are). It doesn't matter too much to my point, but I think it's better that I openly state my bias first so you know to take what I say with a grain of salt. Basically what happened in the us is that when it was founded, the ability of a company to grow to such a large size naturally to buy out enough politicians to make impactful change was seen as impossible without help from an aristocracy that America didn't have. As a result, no anti-corruption legislation was added in the Constitution or initial legislation. As a result of new resources creating new industries (like oil or mass production of steel) allowed very large, wealthy companies and people to come about. These people because using their money to buy out politicians to turn blind eyes, subsidize, give tax breaks, or add tariffs to prevent other markets from \"invading\" the us. Unfortunately, by the time this was becoming obvious, it was too deeply entrenched and too profitable for politicians for anyone to want to do anything about it. A few politicians managed to garner enough support to push out reform, but not enough to fully curb it. This culminates to what we have today, where the us pushes for a supply side economic model (commonly called trickle-down economics by detractors) where the focus of government aid goes to the company. While there is definitely some truth to the belief that supporting businesses directly benefits the economy, this model gets twisted to justify aiding large companies because they bought out the politicians who can make that change.",

Paying $5 more on my taxes to pay for healthcare would be dwarfed by the savings on not having to pay private insurance premiums. Hmmm, 15,000-25,000 a year in premiums for a $4000 deductible or $100 a year with no deductible and less time spent filling out insurance forms and trying to figure out if everyone I see is in my network?

No country has gone free reign with full legalisation, only decriminalisation, and the results so far have been promising.\n\nThere will always be a black market for drugs regardless, especially drugs that should remain restricted like heroin and meth. We shouldn't start a race to the bottom just to out compete old mate on the corner selling an eight ball to his buddy's friend.",

When you include their incredibly high abuse potential it becomes alcohol & cigarettes v2; you go from a small market supplied by underground suppliers to a large market supplied by companies/politicians/etc. The problem becomes entrenched and the inertia in the system makes it impossibly hard to deal with (see: the current opiate epidemic in the context of opiates being restricted).\n\nCriminals will always exist anyway, that's not a good reason to go free for all with problem substances. And maybe this is elitist, but these drugs in particular just have low recreational value IME. There's nothing terribly useful or interesting about heroin and meth, they only serve as an escape for people in bad situations.",

They're too big to so blatantly flout federal law by growing and distributing marijuana the way they do for tobacco now. But they have the scientists, skills, distribution, lobbying power, and marketing prowess to really take over the industry once it's really legalized. This mish-mash of legality is, imo, the only thing holding them back. But once that happens they will make sure they're one of the few that have licenses to grow and distribute. Eventually marijuana will become like beer. There will be a few big national brands and then a bunch of \"micro-brews\" from local growers.",

The city council had just passed a law that forbade alcoholic consumption in public areas; on the streets and on the corners. But the corner is, it was and it always will be the poorman's lounge. It's where a man wants to be on a hot summer's night. It's cheaper than a bar. Catch a nice breeze and watch the girls go on by. But the law is the law so what are the western cops gonna do? They arrest every dude for tipping back a High Life, there'd be no time for any other kind of police work. And if they look the other way, they open themselves up to all kinds of flaunting, all kinds of disrespect. Now, this is before my time but somewhere back in the 50's or the 60's, there was a moment of goddamn genius by some nameless smokehound who comes out the Cut-Rate one day and on his way to the corner he slips that just bought pint of elderberry into a paper bag. A great moment of civic compromise. That small wrinkled ass paper bag allowed the corner boys to have their drink in peace and gave us permission to go and do police work. The kind of police work that's actually worth the effort, that's worth actually taking a bullet for. Dozerman got shot last night buying three vials. Three. There has never been a paper bag for drugs. Until now.",

Some people don\u2019t take issue with this, but if you\u2019ve worked in zero substance FAA repair stations like I have, then it\u2019s a concern. I also worry about irresponsible parents getting children high before school.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in socal and experienced some negative stuff like this firsthand, which I think a lot of people overlook.",

You would think that people would get contact high and it is possible, but many people vape all around with really high nicotine levels and I don\u2019t see people getting addicted to that all of the sudden.\n\nFor teen usage, the myth of teen usage getting worse because of easy access, has been busted in Colorado.\n\nhttps://news.lift.co/five-years-effects-legalization-colorado-washington-state/",

If you force officers to hit a \"productivity\" number, do you think the average officer will want to deal with complex crimes, or do you think they'll want to rack up as many quick arrests as possible to pad their productivity rating? Especially when they have lots of colleagues doing the latter and getting praise for doing so?\n\nIn my state weed is decriminalized but officers still arrested a shitload of people for just weed possession when it was first decriminalized. Not because they had to or because DAs were lying about not wanting to take these cases seriously, but because they still needed numbers and weed was still one of the easiest ways to get there. Only when DAs started (pretty recently) saying stuff like \"we're not going forward with these anymore, stop\" (which affects officer productivity numbers) and PDs held them to it, did the number of those arrests finally drop significantly.\n\nSo I'd be interested to know if internal quota expectations changed at all in precincts in those states once or around the time weed was legalized, or if there were rises in arrests for other easy crimes towards the end of that study period, etc., which would suggest the quota is still a factor in how officers choose cases.",

I'm assuming you can get oil with THC in it there, but not sure. At pretty much every head shop and gas station in the area you can get CBD oil though, and as a former daily smoker, I much prefer dabs to everything. I have depression, anxiety, and insomnia, along with chronic pain and ADD. Dabs make my reaction times slower, I'll admit that, but the best feeling in the world is not having pain... at least until you come down and your body realizes all the pain you've just been ignoring the whole time. CBD mellows the pain, but theres nothing quite as nice as the pain being gone PLUS your brain not making as much noise.",

They may not commit the crime again, but rehabilitation means 'ready to go back into society'.

However, marijuana is no longer the \"Cool\" thing to do, there is research showing that people are using other drugs such as meth, cocaine, heroine and others. In fact, heroine usage is on the rise and that is a big issue as it has always been.",

We get increase in Crime A + no decrease in other crimes (per Ross & Walker) = increase in crime. And whether or not this is true, comparing crime rates before and after a change in law is an apples-and-oranges comparison.\n\nEDIT: Also if you take one look at the clearance rate data, you can see it's very low quality and the straight line fits are forced.",

If a cop happened to pass you, they might ask you to put it out and dispose of it, but that would be the extent of it.\n\nI do realize that San Francisco's experience doesn't necessarily apply to all of the state, but I would bet it was similar in Los Angeles and San Diego as well - for at least the last 20 years.\n\nSo if the clearance rates increase in California, it will really demonstrate how important legalization is.\n\nHere's to hoping it goes further in upcoming years, and use of all drugs is de-criminalized.",

There are too many variables to track in such a scenario, no way to tell which were important to any observed change.\n\nSo the only thing you can do is find situations where the scenario was repeated and try to \"average them\" together to see what happened.\n\nA sample size of two states is not large enough to draw anything approaching concrete conclusions on, but it is useful to gather the data now for these ones, because it may help for figuring out if there is any way to improve data collection for when the next states follow through.",

Second, it increases tax revenue. Third, it's less dangerous than alcohol. Fourth, we will stop wasting time on petty crimes like weed and focus on serious crimes like murder.\n\nWeed has been legal in Colorado for years and it's perfectly fine. Weed has been legal in the Netherlands FOREVER and it's a fine country. No communities have been \"destroyed\".",

While there are significant benefits to decriminalization, legalization sees more harms than good.\n\nEdit: since everyone seems to not care to do their own research about these claims https://www.sanpatrignano.com/what-we-do/sanpa-international/marijuana-legalization-has-led-more-use-and-addiction-while-illegal-market-continues-thrive/\n\nThat's not the source I wanted to find, but I left my Criminal Justice textbook at Uni and can't find an online copy.
